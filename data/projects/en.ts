    articleContent: `Arsvine Realm is this very site. It is built with Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and runs on a Serverless-oriented setup. Visually, it combines sci-fi HUD elements with more than forty kinds of motion treatment, while drawing overall inspiration from Hypergryph's design sensibility.

The project began as a redevelopment of RainMorime, a general portfolio template. From there I added a large amount of custom design and functionality so the site could present my projects and skills in a way that feels more personal. The content spans multiple areas, including web development and game-related work, with the goal of giving visitors a fuller sense of what I care about and what I can build.`,

    articleContent: `The backend is built with Python Flask and served in production with Waitress. It handles banner data and the planning logic. On the frontend, I use vanilla JavaScript for dynamic interaction and responsive layout so the tool remains comfortable to use across different devices.

The project is still in progress. I plan to add more features later, such as account data import and stronger data visualisation. The current link, https://endfield.arsvine.com, is only a placeholder for now and will point to the real deployment later.

The project is split into two pages. The main page focuses on banner simulation, allowing players to simulate pulls across past, current, and even future banners. The other page is a planner that helps players decide how to use their resources toward specific targets. After running Monte Carlo simulations, it produces a score and recommendation.`,
