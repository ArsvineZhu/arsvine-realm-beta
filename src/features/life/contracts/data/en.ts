    articleContent: `For me, Arknights is not just a strategy tower defense mobile game. What truly draws me in is the way it builds a complex and brutal world with a cold, restrained, and highly designed sensibility: the Infected, mobile cities, Catastrophes, national conflicts, corporations, and organisations. None of these settings exists simply to look cool. Together, they support the heavy and convincing order of Terra.

I like its gameplay because victory is not handed over to raw numbers alone. Operator deployment, DP management, route reading, skill timing, and stage mechanics make every operation feel like solving a dynamic systems problem. Why does an enemy come from this lane? Why does a route open at this moment? Why must a skill be held for two more seconds? These details gradually assemble into the real structure of a stage. Failure is not merely failure; it is the system telling me to observe again, infer again, and tune until it finally runs smoothly.

What makes it even more interesting is that Arknights never confines its gameplay to the main stages alone. Integrated Strategies, Stationary Security Service, Stronghold Protocol, Annihilation, and Contingency Contract all keep recombining the core of tower defense into different experimental containers. Stronghold Protocol, in particular, does not attract me simply because of its rewards. What I enjoy is the pressure of multi-lane defense, resource allocation, and long-term construction: not clearing a single stage and leaving, but thinking about how an entire defensive system runs, how it tolerates errors, and how it maintains structure inside chaos. In plain words: give me more Stronghold Protocol.

Black Flow Forest also makes me genuinely curious. It is not merely a new name; it shows that Arknights is still trying to mutate Integrated Strategies further. Freer exploration, stronger map awareness, action points, pursuits, nodes, and shifting in-run resources all give it the feeling of entering an unfamiliar ecosystem. For a player with a research habit like mine, the best part is not copying a solved answer, but entering a new ruleset for the first time and slowly mapping out its boundaries, loopholes, and rhythm. I really want to go to Black Flow Forest.

But the memories Arknights leaves me with come even more from its characters, music, art, and worldbuilding. Rhodes Island does not feel like a simple protagonist faction. It is more like a ship struggling to preserve ideals in a chaotic world. Many stories do not offer easy answers, nor do they package suffering as heroic slogans. Instead, they let people see the complexity of reality: some problems cannot be solved simply, and some sacrifices are not romantic.

I especially like the archival feeling of Arknights. Its UI, event visuals, terminology, faction copy, track titles, and operator records all feel like fragments cut out from a massive system. It does not rush to explain everything. It lets information exist with gaps. Those gaps are exactly what make Terra feel less like a setting sheet and more like a world still running, still accumulating contradictions.

To me, what makes Arknights special is how completely it brings together strategy gameplay, visual design, musical aesthetics, and alternate-world storytelling. What I remember is not only a certain clear, but also the first time its art style caught my eye, the moment I was struck by the weight of its story, and the moment a character's stance moved me. It feels like a world that has accompanied me for a long time, making me think about design, narrative, systems, and creation beyond the game itself.`,

    articleContent: `For me, the most attractive thing about Arknights: Endfield is not simply that it inherits the name Arknights, but that it extends the mood and texture of Terra into a space that is broader, stranger, and closer to a frontier narrative. It is no longer only about Rhodes Island moving between mobile cities and the Infected question; instead, the perspective is pushed toward Talos-II, toward Endfield Industries, and toward a borderland that needs to be explored, built, and understood again.

Compared with Arknights, which leans toward stage design, routes, and skill timing as a strategy tower defense game, Endfield feels like an attempt in another dimension: 3D environments, real-time combat, squad coordination, resource management, and systems with an industrial-construction quality together form an experience of establishing order in an unknown world. What attracts me is exactly this shift from tactical judgement to macro-level planning. The player is not merely completing a battle, but constantly laying paths, organising production, and expanding footholds on an unfamiliar planet, pushing the boundary of civilisation outward bit by bit.

A large part of my interest comes from factory building itself. Factory systems have a calm kind of romance: lines, nodes, resources, inputs, outputs, bottlenecks, and expansion. They look like machines, but they are really a way of learning how to organise a world. When that logic is placed inside the worldbuilding of Arknights, it creates a very particular tension: on one side, wasteland, danger, unknown ecology, and monumental facilities; on the other, human beings trying to carve out a route for themselves through technology and order.

I also like its direction in art and setting. Arknights already has a strong industrial feel, a post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and a cold, restrained design order, while Endfield pushes that mood further toward science fiction and frontier themes: aircraft, facilities, wastelands, Originium protocols, and industrial systems. These elements all make me imagine a civilisation machine slowly starting up in a desolate world. It is not a purely bright future fantasy, but a forward movement carrying pressure, cost, and unknown risk.

So I do not want Endfield to be merely a larger map, more characters, and prettier action. I hope it can preserve the most valuable part of Hypergryph's temperament: restrained visuals, systematic lore, narrative weight, and the patience not to turn ideals into cheap victories. If it can recombine characters, strategy, art, narrative, and system construction into another kind of experience, then it will not be just a spin-off of Arknights. It will become another way for the same worldbuilding to grow.

That is why what I look forward to is not only where the story will go or which characters will appear, but whether it can truly make me feel this: how humanity can establish a new foothold in a strange and dangerous world through technology, organisation, and conviction.

And of course, one more thing: Big Scallion, Little Scallion? I want both.`,

    articleContent: `It is hard for me to simply classify my experience with Death Stranding as finishing a game. What makes it special is not how thrilling the combat is, but how it turns walking, delivery, loneliness, and connection into a real emotional experience. Much of the time, I was only carrying cargo across wastelands, climbing snowy mountains, and avoiding timefall, yet on that long and quiet road I felt a strange weight: not the weight of the mission, but the meaning of placing something into someone else's hands.

Death Stranding is slow, and it even deliberately makes things inconvenient. It makes you bend, lose balance, fall, damage cargo, and feel how long a road can be. But precisely because of that, arrival has weight. Many games treat reaching a destination as a process marker, but Death Stranding turns arrival itself into narrative. You do not teleport in front of someone and complete a task. You really bring the cargo there, through mud, snow, and exhaustion.

What I love most is its asynchronous connection. You are clearly walking alone in the wilderness, yet suddenly you see a ladder, rope, bridge, road, or charging station left by another player. That moment is subtle. You have not met that person, and you may never know who they are, but you have been helped. Connections between people do not always have to be grand. Sometimes it is simply someone, somewhere you cannot see, paving a small stretch of road for those who come later.

That is what moves me the most. The game does not turn connection into empty comfort words. It makes connection a bridge you can step on, a rope you can hold, and a shelter you can stand under. The world has already shattered, but people can still rebuild ties through one small delivery after another. This expression is plain, yet more powerful than many grand slogans.

To me, Death Stranding feels like a long hike, and also like a maintenance log for the ruins of civilisation. It reminds me that rebuilding does not always begin with declaring a magnificent future. Sometimes it begins by delivering today's cargo, repairing this piece of road, and leaving the ladder that once helped me for the next stranger.`,

    imageUrl: cover('zhenjiang-cover.jpg'),
    articleContent: `It really does not count as travel, because I study here.

But exactly because it is not travel, Zhenjiang becomes more real to me. It is not the kind of city compressed by travel guides into a few attractions, a few photos, and one sentence about being worth checking in. Instead, it slowly seeps into daily life while I go to class, eat, walk, hurry somewhere, or simply space out. Its charm does not rush toward you. It appears only after you have walked through it long enough.

Zhenjiang certainly has the parts that are easy to write into an introduction: Jinshan Temple, Xijindu, Jingkou, the Yangtze River, old streets, and pot-lid noodles. But what I like more is the side of it that does not overperform itself. Many places look like ordinary streets and alleys, even a little old and slow, but that slowness is not empty. It feels like a city that leaves the traces of life on its surface: walls, tree shadows, slopes, river wind, evening lights, all carrying a temperament that does not hurry to explain itself.

After living here for a while, I have started to doubt the word travel a little. What truly makes me remember a city is often not the attraction itself, but the light of an ordinary afternoon, the wind that suddenly arrives when I leave campus, the old bricks and new shops I see when walking through Xijindu, and the humid, open, slightly silent air by the river. These things are hard to organise into a standard travel note, but they slowly become the ground color of memory.

So Zhenjiang is an unexpected delight to me. It does not have the fame of Hangzhou or Suzhou, nor does it need to package itself into a perfect Jiangnan fantasy. It feels more like a temporary place to land: not dazzling, but worth looking at; not noisy, but full of echoes. Perhaps because I am not a tourist passing through in a hurry, but someone studying and living here, it has stayed with me in a slower, more private, and more truthful way.`,

    description: 'Creating the worlds in my mind, while studying how systems, interfaces, rules, and narrative hold a world together. I am still on the way, but the path itself is already interesting enough.',

    tech: ['Programming', 'Design'],
    articleContent: `My path into game development did not begin with I want to make a complete game. It began with the worlds, characters, mechanics, and scenes in my mind. I have always liked this way of creating, where imagination can become an interactive experience: not just writing down a piece of setting, and not just drawing an image, but letting players truly step into that world and feel its rules, atmosphere, and emotions.

Right now I mainly use Godot, and I have also tried Unity. To me, the most attractive part of game development is that it contains programming, design, art, narrative, and experiential rhythm at the same time. When I write code, I think about how systems run. When I design mechanics, I think about how players understand and act. When I build scenes, I start thinking about the unity between image, atmosphere, and worldbuilding. The process is complicated, but that complexity is exactly why it fascinates me.

I am easily drawn to systems. Why is this button placed here? Why does this value grow in this way? Why should a tutorial appear at this exact moment? Why can a worldbuilding term make people believe that there are real institutions, histories, and power relations behind it? This is the most interesting part of game development: it is not about finishing code, art, music, and story separately and then gluing them together. It is about making them prove one another. Rules prove the world. Interfaces prove the organisation. Narrative proves the characters. Feedback proves that the player's action matters.

Of course, development is not easy. Many ideas feel complete in my head, but once I try to implement them, all kinds of problems appear: the mechanic is not fun, the code structure becomes messy, the asset style is inconsistent, the project scope is too large, or I simply realise that my current ability is not enough. But these problems also teach me that game development is not a direct sprint toward the finish line. It is a process of decomposition, trial and error, refactoring, and trade-offs, gradually polishing a vague fantasy into something that can be experienced.

The directions I like can probably be described as several mixtures: ancient-tech religion-like ruins and systems, anime post-punk Soviet-style cold order, industrial archive-style information design, and fictional worlds that may look absurd but must remain internally consistent. They may not all become finished works, but they keep entering my design judgement and become part of how I understand games, websites, interfaces, and narrative.

I am still on the way, and I have not yet made something mature enough, but I already enjoy the process. To me, game development is not only a technical exercise, but also a form of expression. It gives me a chance to create worlds of my own, and to turn the things that once existed only in my mind into reality through rules, visuals, and interaction.`,
