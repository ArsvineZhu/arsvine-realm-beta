# ARSVINE REALM

ARSVINE REALM is a personal portfolio and blog site built around a post-apocalyptic sci-fi HUD visual language. It presents projects, experience, life records, blog posts, friend links, and contact information, while keeping interactive features such as a music player, animated route transitions, and WebGL/Three.js atmospheric effects.

![Preview](./docs/preview.png)

## Current Project Status

- **Project type**: personal website, not a generic template guide.
- **Site name**: `ARSVINE REALM`.
- **Author**: `Arsvine Zhu`.
- **Technical baseline**: Next.js 16 Pages Router, React 18, TypeScript, SCSS Modules, Three.js, GSAP, MDX, and a custom Node.js server.
- **Runtime requirement**: Node.js `24.x` (matches the Vercel Project setting; Node 20.9+ still works locally as a compatibility floor).
- **Testing status**: no test framework and no `test` script are configured. Use `npm run lint` and `npm run build` for verification.

## Features

- **HUD-style home page**: five navigation columns leading to works, experience, blog, life, contact/about, and related sections.
- **Animated page transitions**: route changes are coordinated through `TransitionContext`; navigation should go through `useTransition().navigateTo()` instead of direct `router.push()`.
- **Aggregated content page**: `/content` presents the main sections in one scrollable page with hash navigation.
- **Project detail pages**: `/web/[id]` supports rich project detail content, Markdown-style links, Bilibili/GitHub icon links, and copyable tokens configured in `data/projects.ts`.
- **Life detail pages**: `/life/[slug]` renders detailed records from the life data set.
- **MDX blog**: `content/blog/*.mdx` powers the blog list, post pages, RSS feed, and sitemap entries.
- **Music player**: the playlist lives in `data/music.ts`; audio files are placed in `public/music/`. Any format supported by the browser's native `<audio>` decoder can be used, including `.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.wav`, and `.ogg`.
- **Hitokoto proxy**: `/api/hitokoto` proxies `v1.hitokoto.cn` with a 60-second in-process cache and a 5-second timeout. The home-page typewriter alternates between the configured tagline and one hitokoto sentence per cycle.
- **Copyright & License page**: `/copyright` shows bilingual terms (MIT for source, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 for original content); `/license` permanently redirects to `/copyright`.
- **SEO / feed files**: `/sitemap.xml`, `/rss.xml`, and `/robots.txt` are generated from site configuration.
- **Desktop 3D effects**: `RainMorimeEffect` and `TesseractExperience` (powered by `@react-three/cannon` physics) are dynamically imported with SSR disabled and run only on the client.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

> Note: both development and production use the custom `server.js` (a thin Next.js wrapper with graceful-shutdown hooks). It can be replaced with `next dev` / `next start` if you want, but `npm run dev` / `npm start` go through `server.js` by default.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the custom development server: node server.js
npm run build    # Production build: next build
npm start        # Production server: cross-env NODE_ENV=production node server.js
npm run lint     # ESLint flat config: eslint .
```

## Local Dev & COS Referer

The Tencent COS bucket behind `cdn.arsvine.com` only accepts Referer values matching `arsvine.com` / `*.arsvine.com`; `localhost` and empty Referer are both rejected. To let media from `cdn.arsvine.com` load during local development, map `dev.arsvine.com` to the loopback address.

Double-click [scripts/dev-host-setup.cmd](scripts/dev-host-setup.cmd) — it handles:

1. UAC self-elevation to Administrator.
2. Writing `127.0.0.1  dev.arsvine.com` to the Windows hosts file (with a daily `hosts.bak.<yyyymmdd>` backup the first time).
3. If a system proxy is enabled, temporarily adding `dev.arsvine.com` to the current user's `ProxyOverride`.
4. Starting `npm run dev` (port 3000).
5. On Ctrl+C: graceful stop of the dev server, restoring the proxy bypass entry, removing the hosts entry (only if it added it), and `ipconfig /flushdns`.

Manual sub-commands:

```bash
.\scripts\dev-host-setup.cmd -HostsOnly    # write hosts only, do not start dev server
.\scripts\dev-host-setup.cmd -Remove       # clean up the dev.arsvine.com hosts entry
```

> ⚠️ The script edits `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` and, when a system proxy is enabled, temporarily updates the current user's `ProxyOverride`. It requires admin rights, obtained through the standard UAC prompt. If the window is closed via the X button instead of Ctrl+C, the hosts entry or proxy bypass may be left behind — use `-Remove` to clean up.

Open `http://dev.arsvine.com:3000` in the browser; the Referer becomes `dev.arsvine.com:3000` and COS accepts the request.

## Development Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/dev-host-setup.cmd` / `.ps1` | Local dev hosts management + dev server launcher (COS Referer compatibility). Double-click the `.cmd`. |
| `scripts/convert-images.mjs` | Batch image format converter (webp/jpg/png/avif), output to `scripts/images/out/`. |
| `scripts/regen-favicons.mjs` | Regenerate the full favicon set from a transparent source image. |
| `scripts/jpg-to-transparent-png.mjs` | Alpha-unmix a white-background JPG into a true-transparency PNG. |
| `scripts/fetch-google-fonts.mjs` | Reads the Google Fonts URL from `data/site.ts`, fetches the CSS, downloads every woff2, rewrites all `url()` to `cdn.arsvine.com/fonts/`, writes to `public/_fonts-staging/` (gitignored). **Production upload is manual via the Tencent COS web console — `coscli` is not used in this project.** See "Self-hosted Google Fonts" below. |

## Self-hosted Google Fonts (`cdn.arsvine.com/fonts/`)

`fonts.googleapis.com` is unreachable from mainland China, so every visitor (regardless of location) loads fonts from the project's own CDN — a Tencent COS Hong Kong bucket (`arsvine-cdn`) served behind the `cdn.arsvine.com` CNAME. Workflow:

1. **Edit the font config** in [data/site.ts](data/site.ts): update `siteConfig.fonts.googleStylesheet` (a standard Google Fonts URL listing the families and weights you want).
2. **Generate the staging tree locally**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/fetch-google-fonts.mjs
   ```
   The script uses a modern Chrome User-Agent (otherwise Google returns bulkier `.ttf` instead of `.woff2`), downloads all `.woff2`, rewrites every `url()` to `cdn.arsvine.com/fonts/<family>/<file>`, and writes the result to `public/_fonts-staging/` (gitignored).
3. **Upload via Tencent COS web console (not `coscli`)**:
   - Console → bucket `arsvine-cdn` → enter the `fonts/` directory.
   - Upload `public/_fonts-staging/google-fonts.css` and every woff2 subdirectory (use "folder upload" to preserve structure).
   - For `google-fonts.css`, set custom metadata headers (file details → edit metadata):
     - **Key**: `Content-Type` **Value**: `text/css; charset=utf-8`
     - **Key**: `Cache-Control` **Value**: `public, max-age=86400, must-revalidate`
   - Select all woff2 files in bulk → edit metadata:
     - **Key**: `Content-Type` **Value**: `font/woff2`
     - **Key**: `Cache-Control` **Value**: `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`

⚠ **Pitfall (we've been bitten by this)**: in the COS metadata editor, the **Value** field is the value only. Do NOT paste `Cache-Control: public, ...` into the Value — COS will emit `Cache-Control: Cache-Control: public, ...` and Firefox will refuse to render the woff2, silently falling back to system fonts. On a Simplified-Chinese-default Windows, uncommon Traditional Chinese characters then render as tofu.

✅ **Variable Font dedup is intentional**: a compound request like `wght@300;400;500` returns a CSS where multiple `@font-face` blocks (different `font-weight:` values) all point to the **same** woff2 file. That file is a Variable Font whose `wght` axis covers 200–900 (or similar). The browser interpolates the right weight at render time. `fetch-google-fonts.mjs` is built around this — **do not** "fix" the script to force one file per weight.

**Verify the upload**:

```bash
curl -I -H "Referer: https://arsvine.com/" https://cdn.arsvine.com/fonts/google-fonts.css
# Content-Type and Cache-Control must each appear exactly once
```

## Configuration and Content Maintenance

The project now keeps frequently changed content in configuration and data files. Prefer editing `data/`, `content/`, `public/`, and environment variables instead of changing component logic directly.

### Favicon

Icon files live in two places under `public/`:

- `public/favicon.ico` / `public/apple-touch-icon.png` — **kept at the root** because browsers blind-probe these paths (bookmarks, social card fallbacks, iOS "Add to Home Screen").
- `public/icons/` — everything else (`favicon-16x16.png`, `favicon-32x32.png`, `android-chrome-192x192.png`, `android-chrome-512x512.png`, `site.webmanifest`).

All generated from `public/avatar_transparent.webp` (transparent source). After replacing the avatar, regenerate the full favicon set with:

```bash
node scripts/regen-favicons.mjs
```

If the new source is a white-background JPG, convert it to transparent first:

```bash
node scripts/jpg-to-transparent-png.mjs path/to/source.jpg public/favicon-source-transparent.png
# then point scripts/regen-favicons.mjs SRC at that PNG and re-run
```

### Site Configuration

`data/site.ts` is the main entry point for site-wide configuration, including:

- site name, author, email, and copyright start year
- `metaTitle`, `metaDescription`, and RSS description
- home page typing tagline (cycled together with hitokoto sentences)
- social links
- favicon, Open Graph image, and Twitter image
- Google Fonts / preconnect entries
- `htmlLang`, `og:locale`, and RSS language
- page-level SEO and headings for `/content`, `/friends`, and `/copyright`

To make sitemap, RSS, robots, and Open Graph URLs use the production domain, set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

You can also set a default `url` in `data/site.ts`; the environment variable has higher priority.

### Font Conventions

Stylesheets pull fonts through CSS variables defined in [styles/globals.scss](styles/globals.scss):

| Variable | Font | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `--font-display` | `ZELDA Free` | Decorative English HUD titles only. **Latin-only — no CJK glyphs and incomplete accented-Latin coverage (French `é`, `à`, etc. render as tofu).** Never use for blog headers, user-provided content, or anything that may need translation. |
| `--font-hud` | `Dosis` | HUD numerals, labels, and any general-purpose sans (including blog post titles). Variable Font, `wght` axis 200–800. |
| `--font-reading` | `Noto Serif SC` stack | MDX blog body. Variable Font, `wght` axis 200–900. |
| `--font-typewriter` | Courier stack | Typewriter effects and monospaced contexts. |

> History: blog titles used to be `--font-display` (ZELDA Free), but French accented characters and CJK rendered as tofu. They were migrated to `--font-hud` weight 500. For any header or body that may receive arbitrary-language content, **do not** reach for `--font-display`.

### Blog Reading Time

Blog frontmatter does **not** need a `readingTime` field. At build time [lib/blog.ts](lib/blog.ts) calls the in-house `estimateReadingMinutes(content, locale)`:

- CJK characters: 200 cpm (chars per minute)
- Latin words: 115 wpm (words per minute)
- Mixed content is weighted automatically (fenced code, inline code, HTML/JSX tags, MDX `import|export` lines are stripped first)

> These are deliberately a "slow read" pace (about half typical reading speed). Posts often contain code blocks, images, and pause-for-thought passages, so the original 400/230 figures consistently underestimated real reading time. Slow-read became the standard from 2026/06 onward.

UI rendering goes through [lib/format-reading-time.ts](lib/format-reading-time.ts), which formats per the current UI locale. `BlogPostMeta` only carries the numeric `readingMinutes: number`.

> ⚠ **Do not re-introduce the `reading-time` npm package.** It splits on whitespace, so CJK posts are counted as a single "word" and always display as "1 min".

### Content Data

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/projects.ts` | Projects / portfolio data, plus detail-page `copyableTokens` |
| `data/experience.ts` | Education, work, and experience timeline |
| `data/life.ts` | Games, travel, life records, and some configurable Life-section text |
| `data/skills.ts` | Skill tree |
| `data/friendLinks.ts` | Friend links |
| `data/music.ts` | Music player playlist |
| `data/site.ts` | Site identity, SEO, font, locale, and asset configuration |

### Blog Posts

Create `.mdx` files. Recommended structure (one folder per post, one MDX file per locale):

```text
content/blog/<slug>/
├── zh-CN.mdx     # Simplified Chinese (default fallback)
├── zh-TW.mdx     # Traditional Chinese (optional)
├── en.mdx        # English (optional)
├── ja.mdx        # Japanese (content-only locale; surrounding UI stays in user's UI locale)
├── ru.mdx
└── fr.mdx
```

UI locales `zh-CN | zh-TW | en` are defined in [i18n/config.ts](i18n/config.ts). When the requested UI locale lacks an MDX variant, [lib/blog.ts](lib/blog.ts) falls back to `zh-CN` and marks `translationStatus: 'fallback'` — the post page then shows a fallback banner at the top. `ja | ru | fr` are content-only languages exposed via a per-post language switcher inside the post page.

> The legacy layout `content/blog/foo.mdx` / `content/blog/foo.en.mdx` still works, but new posts should use the per-folder structure above.

Frontmatter fields:

```mdx
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2026-01-01"
updated: "2026-01-05"   # optional; RSS / sitemap use updated ?? date
excerpt: "A short excerpt."
tags: ["tag-a", "tag-b"]
pinned: false           # optional; pin to the top of the list
originLocale: zh-CN     # optional; whether this file is the source-language original
---

Write the body in Markdown / MDX.
```

The blog system reads frontmatter and generates:

- `/blog` list
- `/blog/[slug]` post pages
- `/rss.xml`
- `/sitemap.xml`

#### Inline Annotation Components (`<Term>` / `<Explain>`)

[components/mdx/MDXComponents.tsx](components/mdx/MDXComponents.tsx) injects two inline annotation primitives:

| Component | Renders | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `<Term note="...">word</Term>` | Native `<ruby><rt>` — annotation **always visible** above the term | Proper nouns, abbreviations, foreign-language terms — when a tiny inline gloss is enough |
| `<Explain note="...">phrase</Explain>` | Trigger with dotted underline; tooltip on hover (desktop) / click (touch) | Sentence-level explanations, when the note is long enough that you don't want it permanently in view |

```mdx
He read the prompt on the <Term note="National Paper I, the Chinese Gaokao Chinese-language exam">全国 I 卷</Term>.

For a while, he became <Explain note="A long-running mental state of self-driven over-evaluation">a star that refuses to stop burning</Explain>.
```

`<Term>` degrades gracefully on browsers without ruby support (and when copied as plain text) to `word(note)`. `<Explain>` switches to a fixed bottom sheet on mobile so the next paragraph cannot cover it; on desktop the tooltip floats next to the trigger.

### Music Player

The playlist is configured in `data/music.ts`:

```ts
export const musicPlaylist = [
  {
    title: 'Song Title',
    artist: 'Artist Name',
    src: '/music/example.m4a',
  },
];
```

Audio files are hosted on **Tencent COS** (Hong Kong bucket `arsvine-cdn`, region `ap-hongkong`, public-read / private-write) and served from `cdn.arsvine.com` in production — direct from the COS origin, no Tencent CDN in front. `data/music.ts` builds the final `src` by prefixing `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_CDN`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_CDN=https://cdn.arsvine.com
```

When the env is **unset** (typical local dev), `src` falls back to `/music/<file>` and reads from `public/music/` — drop the same filenames there to test playback offline.

The player uses HTML5 `<audio>`, so format support depends on the browser; modern browsers generally support `.m4a` / AAC.

> Audio files are usually large and are excluded from Git tracking by project convention. `public/music/README.md` documents the directory purpose.

### Remote Image Hosts

Remote image allow-list entries for Next.js `<Image>` are centralized in:

```text
config/image-hosts.js
```

When adding an image CDN or object-storage domain, edit only this file, then restart the dev server or rebuild. The defaults include `cdn.arsvine.com` (self-hosted media bucket on Tencent COS Hong Kong), `placehold.co` (placeholder images), and `images.unsplash.com` / `source.unsplash.com` (template samples).

> Post / content images should render via `next/image` with `unoptimized={true}` (direct-linking `cdn.arsvine.com`) to bypass Vercel Hobby's Image Optimization quota (1,000 source images / month) and avoid `/_next/image` re-fetches that would burn the COS outbound-traffic package. COS billing is pay-as-you-go beyond the 10GB monthly traffic package — configure a budget alert in Tencent Billing Center.

### Server Endpoints

- `GET /api/hitokoto`: server-side proxy for `v1.hitokoto.cn`, returns `{ text }`; 60-second in-process cache, 5-second timeout; falls back to `502 { error: 'upstream_unavailable' }` on upstream failure

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example`:

```env
PORT=3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_SRC=https://cloud.umami.is/script.js
# NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID=your-website-id
# NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_DOMAINS=your-domain.com,www.your-domain.com
# NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_CDN=https://cdn.arsvine.com
```

Notes:

- `PORT`: custom server port, default `3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: used by sitemap, RSS, robots, and Open Graph URLs.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_SRC` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID`: optional Umami script config; the `<script>` tag is only injected when `SRC` is set. The injection lives in `pages/_document.tsx` and always carries `defer` / `data-do-not-track="true"` / `data-exclude-search="true"`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_DOMAINS`: optional, comma-separated allowlist (no protocol). When set, the Umami tracker only reports under those domains — `localhost` and Vercel preview deployments are silently skipped, which keeps your stats clean.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDIA_CDN`: optional media CDN base URL (e.g. `https://cdn.arsvine.com`, backed by Tencent COS Hong Kong bucket `arsvine-cdn`). Consumed by `data/music.ts`; when unset the music player serves files from `/public/music/` instead.

### Umami Event Tracking (Optional)

Once the script is injected, pageviews are tracked automatically. To record custom events, simply add `data-umami-event` attributes — no JavaScript required:

```tsx
<a
  href={siteConfig.social.github}
  data-umami-event="Click Social"
  data-umami-event-platform="github"
>
  GitHub
</a>
```

Or call the tracker manually:

```ts
window.umami?.track('Open Life Item', { item: 'arknights' });
```

Event names have a 50-character limit; properties accept arbitrary key-value pairs. This repository does not pre-attach any event tags to components — add them where you actually want a signal.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 (Pages Router)
- React 18
- TypeScript
- SCSS Modules / Sass
- Three.js / `@react-three/fiber` / `@react-three/drei`
- `@react-three/cannon` + `cannon-es` (Tesseract physics)
- GSAP
- MDX / `next-mdx-remote`
- Node.js custom server (thin Next.js wrapper)
- ESLint flat config + `eslint-config-next/core-web-vitals`

## Development Notes

- This project uses the Pages Router, not the App Router.
- `server.js` is the runtime entry. Do not replace it with `next dev` / `next start`.
- Global state primarily flows through `contexts/AppContext.tsx` and `contexts/TransitionContext.tsx`.
- Animation, 3D, typing, and pointer-interaction code may trigger React Compiler lint warnings. Avoid broad rewrites just to silence warnings unless there is a concrete bug.
- For configurable content, check `data/*.ts`, `config/*.js`, and `.env.example` first.
- There is no unit test framework; run at least `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before shipping.

### Known Gotchas (real bugs; don't re-introduce)

- **`--font-display` (ZELDA Free) is Latin-only.** French accented characters and CJK render as tofu. Use `--font-hud` or `--font-reading` for any title/body that may receive arbitrary-language content. See [Font Conventions](#font-conventions).
- **COS metadata Value field is value-only.** Don't paste `Cache-Control: ` as a prefix into the Value field — COS will emit `Cache-Control: Cache-Control: ...` and Firefox will silently fall back to system fonts. See [Self-hosted Google Fonts](#self-hosted-google-fonts-cdnarsvinecomfonts).
- **Do not re-introduce the `reading-time` npm package.** It splits on whitespace, so CJK posts always show "1 min". Use the in-house [estimateReadingMinutes()](lib/blog.ts).
- **Variable Font dedup is intentional Google Fonts behavior**, not a bug. Multiple `font-weight:` blocks pointing at the same woff2 file is correct — the file is a VF whose `wght` axis covers a wide range.
- **This project does not use `coscli`.** Any older doc or script comment that references `coscli sync` / `coscli cp` is obsolete. CDN uploads go through the Tencent COS web console.
- **Navigation must use `useTransition().navigateTo()`**, not `router.push()` — bypassing it breaks the animated page transitions.
- **Mobile section anchors require `scroll-margin-top: var(--mobile-section-scroll-offset)`** ([styles/_sections.scss](styles/_sections.scss)), otherwise hash navigation and `scrollIntoView` place the section title under the HUD.
- **Root-path locale resolution is `NEXT_LOCALE cookie > Accept-Language > zh-CN`** — do not switch to IP-based geo detection; the cookie is the user's explicit choice.

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Or use a process manager:

```bash
pm2 start server.js --name arsvine-realm
```

Recommended production environment variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```
